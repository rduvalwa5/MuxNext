	How to enable remote access to PostgreSQL server on a Plesk server?

Answer
	Note: the instructions below were tested on a Plesk server, however it can be applicable to a non-plesk server as well keeping
	in mind possible different path to the files.

	To enable remote access to PostgreSQL server follow the steps below:

	Connect to the PostgreSQL server via SSH .

	Add the following line to the end of /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf file:

	listen_addresses = '*'

	Add the following line to the end of /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf file:

	host all all 203.0.113.2/32 md5

	203.0.113.2/32 is the remote IP from which connection is allowed. If you want to allow connection from any 
	IP specify 0.0.0.0/0 .md5 is the authentication method, which requires the client to supply a double-MD5-hashed password 
	for authentication. As for other authentication methods refer to PostgreSQL documentation .

	Restart PostgreSQL server to apply the changes:

	# service postgresql restart
